Information transfer in the central nervous system is mediated by two complementary communication modalities: (1) direct point-to-point transmission of electrical signals along neuronal pathways (wired transmission) and (2) gradients of agonist molecules diffusing in the extrasynaptic space (volume transmission). Past neuroscience research has predominantly focused on the wired transmission modality because of its obvious compatibility with established electronic technologies. Nevertheless, as volume transmission processes are increasingly being uncovered and characterized, it is becoming clear that this communication modality also plays an important role in information processing. This notion is further underlined by the recent discovery that neuromodulators, which convey important contextual information such as attention, salience and reward, operate primarily as volume transmission signals. These ascending systems are capable of flushing large volumes of tissue with their respective agonists (e.g., dopamine, acetylcholine, etc.) in transients that last just a few seconds. These fast time scales are thought to enable a reinforcement learning paradigm and have inspired many computational ideas about how neuromodulators might interact with synaptic plasticity to enable this type of learning. To facilitate understanding of how such processes might influence the neuronal circuitry, an \textit{in vitro} system capable of simultaneously monitoring the electrical activity in a neuronal circuit and generating such fast agonist transients is desirable. Microfluidics technology, which allows rapid and precise manipulation of fluid at the micron scale is ideally suited for generating such rapid agonist transients in a controlled manner. This approach also requires use of neuronal cultures because this preparation can be controlled to be of restricted size (i.e., microcultures) which, together with its negligible thickness (a few microns at most), will allow for the agonist to reach the entire tissue at roughly the same time. However, microfluidics applications involving flow and neuronal culture have been very sparse, in part due to a perceived sensitivity of neurons to shear stresses. Additionally, there is a risk that rapid flow would disrupt their signalling and hence their activity.

In this work, we monitored the viability and spiking activity of neuronal culture under microfluidic flow in custom devices with integrated microelectrode arrays (MEAs). We found that both extended viability and stable activity may be achieved under flow but this highly depended on the chemistry of the flow media, which needed to be saturated with conditioning factors secreted from the same cultures. Shear stresses, in contrast were not found to play any role in both the viability and the activity of the cultures. This was corroborated by repeating the measurements under a variety of flow rates and by utilizing a semi-permeable membrane to separate the flow from the cells. This result contradicts the current perceptions in the field and we argue that past reports attributing deleterious effects to shear actually confused it with removal of conditioning factors. We further provided arguments to the effect that rapid microfluidic flow disrupts aspects of extrasynaptic signalling but not the fast synaptic currents and may therefore be used to separate these two processes and investigate the role that each of them plays in generating the network dynamics. After establishing workable flow protocols we proceeded to construct a microfluidic system for generating agonist transients to an entire neuronal microculture grown on MEAs. Since such microcultures are not a standard neuroscience preparation, we demonstrated that they develop normally and exhibit useful spontaneous and evoked activity. We further demonstrated that the agonist transients adhere to physiological time scales through a visualization of the pulse action coupled to a finite element model and through a direct measurement of the cultures' excitation under pulses of glutamate. Finally, we conducted experiments where dopamine pulses were coupled to electrical stimulations. These experiments were designed to validate a classical computational theory predicting how synaptic plasticity may be gated by dopamine to generate effective reinforcement learning. Although we did not observe plasticity, we found a direct modulation of the network activity by the presence of dopamine, which confirms that the cultures possess dopamine machinery and are therefore useful for interrogating related questions. We believe that this system would be useful in validating computational models of neuromodulation and activity which have so far lacked an experimental partner. In a wider perspective, we hope the presented system and the provided data here would lead the way to further microfluidic systems to control the neuronal microenvironment and hence to an improved understanding of the importance of volume transmission to information processing and tissue architecture.
