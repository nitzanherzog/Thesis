I would like, first and fore most, to thank all my supervisors, Noah Russell, Tomas Bellamy and Stephen Coombes for giving me the opportunity to engage in this fascinating and challenging project, for allowing me to take part in an international training network where I received a myriad of invaluable experiences and for providing me with all the conditions to succeed.

I would like to thank my friends and colleagues in the lab, for sharing this unique experience, for teaching me so much, for aspiring to collaborate and for making me feel welcome in this (now less) foreign land, you are (in alphabetical order) Alex Johnstone, Benjamin Paul, Bo Fu, Carmel Howe, Chris Towlson, Dee Thakker, Hala Dhowre, Houda Sahaf, Jamie Williams, Yuezhao Li (Kimi), Raquel Ribeiro, Sebastiaan Van Neufel, Sid Visser and Solomon Idinyang.

I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues in Maths (in alphabetical order) Agne Tilunaite, Alban Levy, David Hawker and Mayte Bonilla for interesting and fruitful conversations and for always lending an ear as well as advice.

I feel indebted to our friends here in the UK, what would we have done without all those family weekends and homely dinners with Inma, Andreas and Matias, Thao, Huang and Susu, Nela, Nuno and Jamie and Paula, Amael and Lara?

I would like to send deep appreciation to my father and his partner Illana as well as my siblings Sharon and Yahel for always standing by to catch me.

At the same time I would like to express my thankfulness to my friends from Israel (in Hebrew alphabetical order): Uri Cammey, Mark Shein, Noah Levine-Small Ran Sofer, Shay Ariely and Tamir Ezer. Our frequent conversations have been a solid rock in my ever changing life.

Lastly and most importantly, I would to send fervent gratitude to my wife Hagit and daughter Amit. Hagit, our relationship has been tested time and again, through very rough and challenging times. Your resilience and understanding in helping me to do what was necessary to go through this Ph.D and to write this thesis will stay with us forever. Amit, thank you for being the lovely and astounding creature that you are.
