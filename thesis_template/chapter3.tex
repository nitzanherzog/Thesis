	\section{Fabrication}

This is where you'd introduce this main section
    \section{Spontaneous activity over time in Mouse cultures}
        images Rat and mouse cultures on MEAs
        example fig with raster plots and the correlation next to it
        \subsection{Activity measure}
        firing rate figure
        \subsection{Synchronicity measures}
        correlation figure
        \subsection{Burst measures}
        burst measures figure
        \subsection{Comparison between platings}
        Refer to previous images with other plating data
    \section{Evoked activity}
    Evoked activity example in rat culture
    \section{Attempts to induce plasticity}
    Why I selected the Chiappalone  protocol protocol
        \subsection{Examining firing rate changes}
        \subsection{Examining functional connectivity changes}
